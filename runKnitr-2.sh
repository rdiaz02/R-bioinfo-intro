## Without the links, you can go from the PDF to
## Emacs, but not the other way around because emacs complaints that it
## cannot find a *.Rnw.pdf. And not, I cannot get past that.
## If you create that, via symlink, then when you
## try to go from Emacs to the PDF, it opens a new viewer. And from that
## one you cannot move back to Emacs.
## I just need to link $.synctex.gz to $.Rnw.synctex.gz
## and .pdf to Rnw.pdf and C-c C-v from emacs. That's it.
## From PDF to emacs by shift-left click (always as "browse tool" with mouse)
## Of course, needs emacs to have the server started

## if run from shell, can jump to error, but goes to .tex, not .Rnw

## It would be great to have this work from Emacs with C-c C-c
## maybe with start-process or similar. I have it now linked to M-n r
